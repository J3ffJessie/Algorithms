# Day 1 of CS Block in VWC Cohort

## Philip Tenteromano - Instructor

## Basic Introduction
1. Military Background
2. Code Background
3. Hopes for CS block of the course.

## Computer Science
- The study of computers and how they work.
    - The way things work.
    - How we utilize the best solution to solve the current problem.

## Tools
- JS/HTML/CSS/React are the Oxygen we breathe
-CS is more like Water
    - Don't have to have it all the time
    - Good to have and needed to survive

### Slide Show

1. Big O [First Big Block] 
    - <b>Wednesday</b>
2. Recursion 
    - <b>Thursday</b>
3. Data Structures
4. Algorithm Practice
5. Sorting and Searching
6. Code Style & Structure

- Our focus in <i>not</i> big projects
- We want to focus on concepts
- Quick code snippets
- Functions that utilize these concepts
- Mostly single .js files
- Build confidence and javascript knowledge

# How To Succeed
## Exposure + Time = Learning
1. Ask Questions
2. Do the work
3. If you don't understand something, break it down smaller to the unit you do understand. Then reverse engineer it, piecing it together like a puzzle.

## Advice
1. Deeply document your code - you will be Incredibly thankful you did when you come back to it.
2. Make a repo on your personal github called Algorithms.
3. Push your algorithm code up to this repo- you will get a green box + easily accessible code.
4. This means, whether you solved a problem on REPL.it, Hackerrank, leetcode, excercism....just make a .js file and push it.  All your algorithm code in one place.
5. Struggling is good.  Code is hard.  Nobody knows everything.


### Critical Thinking Question
1. How many race horses does it take to find the top 3 horses?
    - 25 horses, 5 lanes, 1 horse per lane
     - no time keeping
     - How many races would it take to find the best 3 horses out of the 25?
2. Brute Force (Algorithms)
    - A simple, intuitive way to use our available resources without much regard for efficiency.
    - Race 5 horses
     - 1 race
        - 20 horses left
            - 25 -5
    - Who are our top 3 in the race? Keep those
        - Bottom 2 get dropped
        - Two lanes just opened up on the track.
        - Lets fill those lanes with 2 horses out of our remaining 20 horses.

#### 11 Races Total to find the Top 3 Horses

3. Efficient Race - Top 3 Horses
    - 25 horses / 5 lanes = 5 Race Winners Advance
    - Top Finisher is automatically Champion
    - Bottom 2 of Bracket 1 are eliminated, anything finishing after 3rd horse in respective bracket is eliminated
    - Only possible outcomes for Top 3 horses are [0,5,10] [0,1,2] [0,1,5] [0,5,6]

## Curriculum for the next 3 Weeks
### Week 1
- Big O
    - The metric for Algorithms
- Call Stack.
    - How code is interpreted by the machine
- Recursion.
    - The art of the hand off.
