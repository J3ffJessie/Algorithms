# VetsWhoCode Algorithms WorkBook

## Experience with Math and CS
- I have absolutely no proper experience with computer science at all.  No college courses or real world experience that I am aware of.
- I absolutely despise Math outside of basic Math.  I can do Algebra but I haven't really touched the more intricate parts of it in about 5 years.


## What I hope to learn from this portion of the Cohort
- That Math really isn't that bad (would appease my Wife, who is a Math Teacher)
- The inner workings of why everyone says CS is so important
- The ins and outs of working with Algorithms and how to get my mind wrapped around troubleshooting challenges with Algorithms
